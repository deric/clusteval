k-Medoids (PAM)
===============
Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) is one of the most common realizations of the k-medoid clustering approach, which uses exemplars as cluster centers. The algorithm works identical to k-means except that the exemplars are updated by testing each object in each cluster as exemplar instead of calculating artificial mean objects (centroids).
